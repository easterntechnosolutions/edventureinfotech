                <p>For many developers, software architecture and design are overlooked, which might hinder the application's performance and development velocity. Other projects may suffer from big design up front, which can cause unnecessary complexity and delay feedback that would otherwise come organically during implementation.</p>
                <p>We have a pragmatic approach to architecture and design issues. We pinpoint the most significant areas that are worth investing upfront time, and prioritize others afterwards, where the design comes only after more critical development iterations are finished.

                        <p>If you have an interest in coding and graphic design, then there’s nothing to say you shouldn’t learn skills in both areas. They often work hand-in-hand, so having knowledge and skills in both areas could be desirable for certain career paths. You could also think about pursuing something in between like UI design, which is a very in-demand career right now!
                            <br><br>
                            In general, having design skills along with coding skills is helpful. But it’s also okay to do one over the other. My advice would be to just get started! You can always change directions later… as long as you’re changing directions to the final destination you’re looking for!
