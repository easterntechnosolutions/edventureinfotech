               <p>The idea behind the project was to grant Forward customers accessibility to their services via developing a web and a mobile platform that standardize partnership models between freighters and shippers and ensures the smooth ongoing of the management freight process. Customers can monitor and track their freight individually and receive timely updates, related reports, and proper documentation as well as a direct communication portal to the operating team until delivery.</p>

            <p class="faced-font">Establishing a robust entity management system to manage all users</p>

         <div class="col-md-8 col-lg-8 case-details-h2 faced-margin"> 
               <p>Our teamâ€™s main challenges included the creation of a centralized entity management system to manage all users and assign them roles, as well as an accounting system to manage and validate data points like invoices, quotes, journals, and audit trails. It was also crucial to implement a container tracking module that allows the company to manage its shipments and consolidate movements from various carriers.</p>

            <h2 class="client-cs-sub-title">Project Approach</h2>          
            <p>We assigned a business analyst to conduct a detailed discovery workshop with our client to understand the project requirements and write business rule documents, draw mind maps, create flow charts and ensure the consent of the client for every step.</p>
            <p>After the Project Workshop, we created the Project Plan and Work Breakdown Structure for the project to set the scope for the development phase. This project was divided into six deliverables and a final release.</p>
            <p>We have also aligned a quality assurance team to identify the validation criteria for each step of the project development for the developers to conduct unit testing and for the audit to ensure the project meets the quality standards.</p>
            <p>During the development phase, we maintained a continuous testing, reviewing, and validation approach per task on a daily basis and per module while carrying out an efficient documentation and reporting process regularly.</p>
            <p>We maintained biweekly communication and demo sessions with our client and the involved stakeholders to take feedback on each deliverable to detect nonconformities and take corrective actions.</p>
