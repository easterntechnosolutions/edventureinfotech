                <p>Developers often underestimate the significance of software architecture and design, potentially impeding both application performance and development speed. Conversely, some projects may grapple with excessive upfront design, leading to unwarranted intricacy and postponing feedback that could naturally emerge during the implementation phase.</p>
                <p>We adopt a practical approach to architecture and design challenges. We identify the pivotal areas that merit initial investment of time and prioritize others for later stages, focusing on design once critical development iterations are completed.</p>

                        <p>If you have an interest in coding and graphic design, then thereâ€™s nothing to say you shouldnâ€™t learn skills in both areas. They often work hand-in-hand, so having knowledge and skills in both areas could be desirable for certain career paths. You could also think about pursuing something in between like UI design, which is a very in-demand career right now!
                            <br><br>
                            In general, having design skills along with coding skills is helpful. But itâ€™s also okay to do one over the other. My advice would be to just get started! You can always change directions laterâ€¦ as long as youâ€™re changing directions to the final destination youâ€™re looking for!
